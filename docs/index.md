# What it means!

To me a Senior Software Engineer is a person that people go to when they have questions. Why? Because they trust that person to either have the answer, know who has that answer, or know how to find the answer. Over the past 5 plus years working within the Rocket Pro TPO stream I have had to stretch myself extensively in the later two categories. I have found that TPO, as a stream, doesn't know everything about all of our systems. Instead, we have to leverage other teams outside of our own to find the experts in any given area, and then work with those experts to find the best solution for the task at hand. Specifically I have more recently been serving a role with the KaosControl (f.k.a. Stability and Support) where various issues with our AMP system have come my way. My job was to disect the issue enough to be able to understand the process and ultimately to come up with a best solution. One such example is Story 2138308: CW: AMP QFR Failure - Prepaid Finance Charge not >= 0. On this story I had to reach out to several teams including the Fees team and pull in experts to help troubleshoot and design a fix.
