# Desired Characteristics

## Talent Development and Aquisition

* I have helped mentor AshaRani SreedharanNair as a new engineer with the FOC and TPO.
* I helped mentor Harsha Anche in working with Progress Open Edge. Harsha is an existing engineer on the TPO stream but was unfamiliar with AMP and Progress.
* I am currently assisting with mentoring Steve Chakif as a new Engineer to the TPO stream and new AMP engineer.
* Also I am frequently asked questions from several AMP engineers from the stream about newer processes related to GIT, OOO, and Code Ownership.
* I have recently been involved in a handful of interviews, hoping to volunteer for more when the opportunity presents itself.
* While still a work in progress, I have plans to develop presentations for our stream about AMP including but not limited to: Loantimers, Tracking Items, and Progress Engineering for non-Progress Engineers.

>***Another interview!***<br/>
>Thanks to Mike for joining another interview panel for a progress software engineer to help build the new Correspondent train. He always asks great questions and has valuable feedback on the candidate after the interview.

>*We are the "they."*<br/>
>***Mentoring Master***<br/>
>Thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to mentor Steve Chakif as he onboards to TPO. You have been so helpful in answering questions about the Packet System, scheduling, and AMP in general. Pointing Steve in the right direction to get access was a huge help!

>:mega: **You received recognition from Barb Alloway**<br/>
>*The inches we need are everywhere around us.*<br/>
>***Mentoring***<br/>
>Mike, thank you for mentoring Asha with all of the email modifications, json files, AMP msg questions, weird issues, and crazy testing research. Thank you for your time, patience, helping Asha get these across the finish line!

## Autonomy

* As part of the TPO stream our AMP engineers are quite spread out and as a result frequently have to work independently. For example, I had to work independently while consulting with a Thrid Party vendor for the client. This is in a nut shell was a problem with the way we were sending the logo in emails generated directly from AMP. Once we found the issue I tried several options to try to fix this ultimately landing on the idea that we need to have a publicly available CDN where we can store the logo and then in the email point to that CDN rather than encoding the attachment directly.

## Support

* As part of Stability and Support, I really flexed this muscle and continue to do so. I have written several queries and fix programs over the last 2 years. I have researched stories as simple as a quick fix and as complex as diving into the world of fees. I have had to rely on resources to help dig in from both internal to the TPO stream, outside the stream, and even outside the company.
* Worked on a hot item where the Origination fee was not getting cleared out when Lender Fee buyout was selected. This required a quick turn around as it was costing the company money on each of these loans. Story 2172464: CW: AMP: Lender Fee Buyout, fee not getting cleared

>:mega: **You received recognition from Lisa Magill**<br/>
>*Responding with a sense of urgency is the ante to play.*<br/>
>***Thanks for jumping in quick to research prod error***<br/>
>Overnight the ItTeamQLMSAmpEngineers got about a dozen emails alerting us to errors occurring in qlms-additionalinfo. Mike was the first to dig into the log files and identify the error so it could be sent over to the capability owner to get it resolved. Thanks for the Yes before No, every client every time, and the urgency!

>:mega: **You received recognition from Brandi Costello**<br/>
>*Every client. Every time. No exceptions. No excuses.*<br/>
>***CCUD Issue***<br/>
>Thank you for taking the time to come up with a fix program (twice). It helped get this loan moving and able to set up closing


## Communication

* Simplicity is Genius comes to mind with communication. I strive to explain anything at the simplest level then dive deeper depending on the audience and the questions that come up. I have used that process when having to discuss an issue during Tech Incidents, planning, and even meetings. Frequently we need to explain complicated technical processes to fellow team members that aren't necessarily as technical as an engineer.

>:mega: **You received recognition from Barb Alloway**<br/>
>*We'll figure it out.*<br/>
>***You are Appreciated!!!***<br/>
>Mike, thank you for jumping on a call with me and sorting through an Interface and Program to determine if we were owners. You were able to provide me with how old the program was and that, yes we did make a modification to the program, but we are certainly not the owners. I also appreciate you working with me to finalize our response.

## Ownership

* Over the last several months I have joined up with the Rocket Technology Ownership Club as an engineer and as a representative from the TPO stream. The Ownership Club is across all of Rocket Technology our goal is have a repeatable, application agnostic process to streamline and standardize the steps needed to successfully support and facilitate stakeholder conversations that result in capability ownership decisions. While the team's primary focus is to find owners for things that appear to have no owner, I am also able to give insight as to what parts TPO might own.
* I have made a couple of changes to the CODEOWNERS file for the AMP/ampgate repo and have been championing the ownership process for the TPO train.
* I currently own and help to facilitate our TPO AMP code review block. With our spread out set of AMP Engineers across the TPO stream, it can be difficult for us to gather to review each others code. I have created two time slots each day that we are able to use to gather and pool our resources.
* I own the TPO AMP Engineer bi-weekly stand-up. Again with our spread across the stream this is a time we can gather to share the work we have done, ask questions of our fellow engineers, and share anything we have learned that might be valuable to everyone. On our stream our AMP engineers have to work as a virtual team and this meeting helps us to stay connected.

## Technical Expertise

* Clearly I am a Progress Engineer through and through. I have been programming Progress for the last 15+ years. I have worked on expanding my knowledge on Object-Oriented Programming with Progress and OERA.
* Also as part of the KaosControl I am working on learning more about load testing tools and automated testing. I'd like to take the knowledge there and find a way to bring it back to the AMP world in any way I can so we can create a more stable system.

## Quality

* As I mentioned earlier I have a passion for quality. I want to help to advocate for getting out systems to work harder for us. I want to get alerts from AMP and from our other systems sooner rather than later. I would love to see our technology team find out about problems before our partners even notice it. While yes an ouce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, reality is that problems still exist in production. If we can have more systematic observations going on we can then alert when things go 'sideways', we can find out there is a problem sooner, and we can react with more certainty because we have more information up front. I worked on a project to enhance our dashboard and alerting for loantimers that is alerting us when the system auto restarts multiple times in a short period of time. I built a dashboard to give us more visual information and an alert that fires when there are more than 2 restarts in a 20 minute period. This alert sends an email and a teams message, it also includes the log locations to help the responder get to the logs faster and be able to diagnose the problem faster.

## Architecture

* Request 852269: Changes to Regional Vice President and Market Director linking in XBERT and AMP

    This story really push my learning on the OOO side and allowed me the opportunity to lean into OOO. I built much of this utilizing the OERA pattern and learned a lot. I was also able to help Charl troublshoot the tool he built for creating the data layer classes.
